# TOML file to determine which brain regions should be merged together.
# Regions are referenced by their exact acronym.
# The syntax should be the following :
# 
#   [MY]
#   name = "Medulla"  # new or existing full name
#   acronym = "MY"  # new or existing acronym
#   members = ["MY-mot", "MY-sat"]  # existing Allen Brain acronyms that should belong to the new region
#
# Then, regions labelled "MY-mot" and "MY-sat" will be labelled "MY" and will join regions already labelled "MY".
# What's in [] does not matter but must be unique and is used to group each blocks.
# The new "name" and "acronym" can be existing Allen Brain regions or a new (meaningful) one.
# Notes :
# - It is case sensitive.
# - If a Brainglobe atlas is specified in the configuration file, by default, cuisto will remove any
# non-leaf regions (eg. any regions that have child region in the atlas ontology) *before* the merging
# defined here. This means that if members are non-leaf regions, they will be discarded before the merge
# and NOT be included in the new custom region.
