# Getting help

For help in QuPath, ABBA, Fiji or any image processing-related questions, your one stop is [the image.sc forum](https://forum.image.sc). There, you can search with specific tags (`#qupath`, `#abba`, ...). You can also ask questions or even answer to some by creating an account !

For help with `histoquant` in particular, you can open an issue in Github (which requires an account as well), or send an email to [me](mailto:g.legoc@posteo.org) or [Antoine Lesage](mailto:antoine.lesage@cnrs.fr).
